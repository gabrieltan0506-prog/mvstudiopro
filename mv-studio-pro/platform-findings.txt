Platform section findings:
- At the top of this viewport, I can see 4 small boxes labeled 21, 22, 23, 24 (小紅書, B站, 抖音, 視頻號)
- They appear as small colored squares/circles at the top
- The platform logos section seems to be above this viewport - need to scroll up slightly
- Below is the contact form section with all fields visible

Need to check if platform logos are actually showing images or just text/emoji icons.
