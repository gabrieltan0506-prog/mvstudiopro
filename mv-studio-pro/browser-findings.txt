Browser findings:
1. Login button visible in nav bar (index 5) - CONFIRMED WORKING
2. All 7 MVs visible in the grid: 紅裙舞曲, 城市夜曲, 雨中深情, 天使之翼, 花園晨曦, 微笑瞬間, 愛的旋律 - CONFIRMED
3. Feature cards visible with icons: MV展廳, MV智能分析, 虛擬偶像工坊, 視覺特效引擎, 多平台發布 - CONFIRMED
4. Platform logos: 小紅書, B站, 抖音, 視頻號 - CONFIRMED
5. Contact form visible at bottom - CONFIRMED
6. Footer visible - CONFIRMED
7. Page seems to be fully rendered on a single viewport (no scroll needed) - the page is compact

ISSUE: The page reached bottom edge immediately - the page content seems to be cut off or not scrollable properly. Need to check if the ScrollView is working correctly.
Actually looking at the element list, ALL content is visible (items 1-31 include everything from nav to footer). The page fits in one viewport because the mobile preview is rendering the full page.
