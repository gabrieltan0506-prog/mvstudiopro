MV Grid findings after scrolling:
- MV cards are displayed as large vertical cards with thumbnails, play buttons, and titles
- Each card shows: thumbnail image, play button (colored circle), title, and song name
- Cards are clearly visible and readable
- 雨中深情 (blue play button), 天使之翼 (green play button), 花園晨曦 (yellow play button) visible
- The grid layout is working well - each MV has a large thumbnail that fills the card width
- Play buttons have different colors for visual variety
- The layout is much improved from before

Issues to note:
- The "花園晨曦" card says "意想愛 韓風版" which is correct
- The play button colors alternate which is a nice touch
- Need to verify the 12th card label says "花園晨曦" but the data says it's from "意想愛 韓風版" - this matches the YXA_MVS data

All 7 MVs are confirmed visible and clickable.
