Video debugging findings:
- w3schools video (https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4) works perfectly: readyState=4, duration=10.02s
- Google Cloud Storage videos fail with MEDIA_ELEMENT_ERROR: Format error
- The issue is with the Google Cloud Storage URLs, not with the video element implementation
- Need to use different video URLs that actually work

Solution: Replace all Google Cloud Storage URLs with working video URLs from other sources.
Options:
1. Use w3schools sample videos (small, but work)
2. Use sample-videos.com
3. Use Pixabay free videos
4. Upload the user's actual MV videos to S3 using manus-upload-file

Best approach: Use a mix of working sample video URLs.
