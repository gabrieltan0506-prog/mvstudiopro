Screenshot analysis:
- Login button (red circle) visible in top-right corner of nav bar - GOOD
- Hero section looks good with floating album covers
- "精華 MV 集錦" section visible below
- Need to scroll down to see the MV grid cards and other sections
- The "background" and "animation" style warnings are expected - they are web-only CSS properties that RN logs as warnings but work fine on web
