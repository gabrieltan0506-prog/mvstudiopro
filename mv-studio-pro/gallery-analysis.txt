MV Gallery Layout Analysis:
- thumbnailContainer height is only 180px - too small to see clearly
- Card titles at 19px are fine but the overall card is cramped
- The FlatList renders cards vertically with 16px gap
- Each card has: thumbnail (180px) + info section + optional expanded details
- The thumbnail has overlay badges (format, score, duration) that clutter the small space
- Need to increase thumbnail height and improve overall card readability
- The video player inline component works but requires expanding the card first

Fix plan:
1. Increase thumbnail height from 180 to 240
2. Make card title and subtitle more prominent
3. Ensure all 7 MVs are clearly visible with better spacing
4. The card layout is already functional - main issue is thumbnail size
