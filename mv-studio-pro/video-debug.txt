Video playback debug:
- The Google Cloud Storage video URL is returning MEDIA_ELEMENT_ERROR: Format error
- networkState: 3 (NETWORK_NO_SOURCE)
- readyState: 0 (HAVE_NOTHING)
- This is likely because the http:// URL is being blocked by the https:// page (mixed content)
- Need to use https:// URLs instead of http://

Fix: Change all video URLs from http:// to https://
